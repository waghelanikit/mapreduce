# Generate JAR and build project in project root
# mvn clean install

# this will clean all the projects inside mapred dir and build them again
# the JAR will be generated inside [a1 a2]/target directory

# Use the runner tool in project root to selectively run the assignments
# ./runner.sh [input file path] [-i]
# -i -- stands for mvn install

# code is present in a1 and a2 src directory

# running mvn clean install in project root will automatically build all the
# nested projects

# output of each version will be saved in output directory in project root (outside a1 and a2)
# if not found, please check HDFS /tmp/ directory.

# if runner script fails, go to target directory in a1 and a2 to get the JAR and execute them manually
